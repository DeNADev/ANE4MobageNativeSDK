Known Issues
==========================================================================
- Exporting apk file from FlashBuilder will automatically add "air." to the package name
  which will cause issues with remote notification. It will not affect apkâ€™s through our Production submission since developer site will fix this automatically. See Programing
  Guide section "How to setup correct Android package name when exporting for release
  build?" for more details.

- Under a specific condition on Android 3.x, an issue is found where
  the screen orientation of the Mobage login view is not handled correctly.
  This issue is observed on Galaxy TAB 7.0 / 10.1 with Android 3.2.

- On some Optimus devices, an issue is found where the new user registration
  web view does not close upon registration success. Pressing the back key
  dismisses the web view and player can continue with the game normally.
  This issue is observed on Optimus PAD Android 3.0.1
